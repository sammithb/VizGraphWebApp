      <h2>Mathematical Background</h2><br>
      <p>
        The Visibility Graph problem arises originally from the Art Gallery Problem in Geometry. Imagine a polygonal region that represents an art gallery. The goal of this problem is to determine the minimum number of guards that are 
        needed such that every point inside the gallery is under surveillance. This leads us to a question that follows: How can we mathematically 
        describe what each guard can see? <br><br>

        Visibility between the points in the polygon is key to solving this problem. If every vertex within the polygon can "see" each other (meaning a line segment 
        can be drawn such that it connects two points while remaining entirely inside the region - we will put a picture to demonstrate). In this case, 
        a single guard can protect the entire region. This insight then takes us to our question: the visibility graph problem. A visibility graph can be constructed 
        by considering each vertex on the polygon as a node on the graph. We then connect two nodes with an edge if one vertex can see another within the polygon. <br><br>

        The unsolved question (from Devadoss and O'Rourke) is to be able to characterize graphs as visibility graphs of polygons. <br><br>

        This tool gives you the ability to view in real-time how the visibility graph of a polygon changes as different vertices of the polygon are being manipulated, 
        being a perfect tool to get closer to finding an answer to the problem. <br><br>
